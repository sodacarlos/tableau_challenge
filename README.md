### Analysis:

In the first dashboard shows the number of rides for the first semester of 2022 which is close to 3.5M.
It is also possible to see a growth for both users: members and casual.
The most common time to start a ride during the summer and winter was at 6 o'clock, and both seasons had remarkably comparable profiles for this time, meaning there can be other elements that affect ride start time.
The number of users grows, so does the overall ride time in hours; nonetheless, the typical ride time stays consistent month to month, suggesting that ride length might not be affected by the time of year or the weather.
The top 100 beginning points are shown on the map, and the size of each marker indicates how many rides originate from that station.
More people frequent the stations close to Manhattan's central business district, which makes sense for both commuters and tourists.
